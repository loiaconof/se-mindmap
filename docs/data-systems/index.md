# Data Systems

## Common needed functionallities:

- **Databases** - storing data
- **Caches** - remember the result of expensive operation
- **Search Indexes** - allow users to search data by keyword
- **Stream Processing** - send message to another process, to be handled asynchronously
- **Batch Processing** - periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data

## Concerns About Data System Applications

- [Reliability](/docs/data-systems/concerns/reliability.md) - Ensures the system performs consistently and recovers gracefully from failures.
- [Scalability](/docs/data-systems/concerns/scalability.md) - Measures the systemâ€™s ability to handle growth in data volume or user load.
- [Maintainability](/docs/data-systems/concerns/maintainability.md) - Refers to how easily the system can be updated, debugged, or extended.
