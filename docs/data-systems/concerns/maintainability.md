# Maintainability

We can—and should—design software in a way that minimizes pain during maintenance, and thus helps avoid turning it into legacy software.

To achieve this, we focus on three key design principles for software systems:

## Operability

Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.

Responsabilities to take care:
- **Monitoring**
- **Tracking**
- **

## Simplicity

Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible for the system.

## Evolvability

Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases and requirements change. Also known as **Extensibility**, **Modifiability** or **Plasticity**
