# Domain Driven Design ( DDD )

Domain-driven Design ( DDD ) propose to attack the root cause for failed comunication from a different angle. Effective comunication is the central theme of the domain-driven design tools and practices.

DDD can be divided in two parts: [strategic](/docs/software-design-architecture/ddd/strategic-design.md) and [tactical](/docs/software-design-architecture/ddd/tactical-design.md).

The [strategic](/docs/software-design-architecture/ddd/strategic-design.md) tools of DDD are used to **analyze business domain and strategy**, and to foster a shared understanding of the business between different stakeholders. We will also use this knowledge of the business domain to drive high-level design decisions: **decomposing** systems into components and defining their integration patterns.

DDD's [tactical](/docs/software-design-architecture/ddd/tactical-design.md) tools address different aspect of communication issues. DDD's tactical patterns allow us to write code in a way that reflects the business domain, addresses its goals, and speaks the language of the business.

Domain-driven Design will make you more effective by alleviating the process of making sense of business domains and guiding the design decisions according to the business strategy.
