# AWS Global Infrastructure

The [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) is a secure, extensive, and reliable network of data centers that powers cloud services across the globe. It is designed to deliver high availability, low latency, and scalability for workloads of any size.

- **AWS Regions** – Geographical areas that host multiple, isolated Availability Zones.
- **AWS Availability Zones** – Multiple, isolated locations within each Region for fault tolerance.
- **AWS Data Centers** – Physical facilities housing the hardware for compute, storage, and networking.
- **AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence** – Locations that cache content closer to users for faster delivery through services like Amazon CloudFront.

## AWS Regions

Geographical areas that host multiple, isolated Availability Zones.

How to choose an AWS Region:

- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency
- **Available** services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
